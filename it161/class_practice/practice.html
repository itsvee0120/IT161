    <h3>A little bit about me!</h3>

    <img src="images/Violet.jpeg" alt="Violet Nguyen"> 


    <p> My name is <strong id="strong1">Violet Nguyen</strong> (violet like the theme of this portal page).
         I'm currently working toward my<strong><a id="a1" href="https://northseattle.edu/programs/application-development/application-development-bachelor-applied-science-bas-degree">
         Bachelor's in Application Development</a></strong> (click on the text if you 
         are interested in learing more). I'm a student leader here at North and also work at 
         the Student Media Center as a navigator. I was born in the beautiful country 
         Vietnam. I moved to the U.S. at the age of 13 alone to pursue education, and it's been 
         7 years since then. I love the color <i id="i1"><b>green</b></i> !</p>
        
    <p>I am taking IT161 this quarter to <em>enhance my understanding of HTML and CSS.</em>
         I had previously learned them on my own and completed a few project websites. My 
         goal is to be a well rounded software developer. I enjoy body piercings, and have 
         a few of them myself. My favorite has to be my septum piercing
         (though, I took it out for this picture).
